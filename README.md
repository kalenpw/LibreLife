# LibreLife
Clean life counter app for Magic the Gathering 

[MTG Familair](https://github.com/AEFeinstein/mtg-familiar) is a great app however I find the life counter
portion to be quite ugly and lacking of a layout that makes it easy to place in the center of the table for everyone to use.

LibreLife has simple clickable rectangle that can be arranged to match the layout of the table and track everyone's life totals.
Designed with EDH(best format) in mind, but would work with any format.
